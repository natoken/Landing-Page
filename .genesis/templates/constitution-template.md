### Documentation
- {Requirement}: {standard}

## 5. Testing Philosophy

<!-- GUIDANCE: Required coverage levels, testing approach (TDD, BDD, integration-first), what must be tested vs. optional. -->
<!-- IF: Lowfield — rename to "Quality Standards" and define accuracy, completeness, consistency, review process. -->

## 6. Quality Gates

<!-- GUIDANCE: What must be true before code is considered complete. Linting, type safety, test passage, review requirements. -->
<!-- IF: Lowfield — rename to "Completion Criteria" and define what makes a content entry "done". -->

- [ ] {Gate 1}
- [ ] {Gate 2}
- [ ] {Gate 3}

## 7. Security & Compliance

<!-- GUIDANCE: Data handling rules, authentication/authorization patterns, regulatory constraints, secrets management. -->

- **Authentication:** {pattern}

## 11. Amendment Process

### Amendment Tiers

| Tier | Sections | Requirements |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Foundational** | 1 (Mission), 2 (Tech Stack), 3 (Architecture) | Full impact analysis, review all existing artifacts |
| **Standard** | 4-8, 10 | Impact analysis, spot-check recent artifacts |
| **Advisory** | 9 (Documentation), 11 (Amendments) | Justification only |

### Amendment Procedure

To amend this constitution:
1. The user must explicitly request the amendment (or use `/genesis:amend`)
2. The amendment tier determines the review depth required
3. The rationale must be documented
4. Impact on existing artifacts must be assessed (per tier)
5. The user must approve the amendment
6. The amendment is logged below with date, rationale, and what changed
7. Precedents affected by the amendment should be reviewed (see `.genesis/design/precedents.md`)

### Review Schedule

**Review after every:** {N} completed features
**Last reviewed:** Never
**Next review due:** After feature #{N}

## 12. Legacy Handling

<!-- GUIDANCE: How to treat existing code that doesn't meet the constitution. For each area, choose: Immediate refactor, Progressive migration (refactor when touched + deadline), or Grandfather clause (accepted as-is with optional sunset). -->

| Area | Strategy | Deadline | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| {area} | {Immediate\|Progressive\|Grandfather} | {date or "None"} | {notes} |
